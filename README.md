### OOPS_Python-Employee_Database_Application
The repository contains database-driven Employee Management System in Python that will store the information in the Database.

The  Script contains the following operations:
1. To add an employee
2. To print the name and address of employees
3. To print the employee name and compensation of all employees
4. To search for employees by name
5. To check the basic statistics of employees
6. To calculate the reimbursement of one employee

#### The main advantage of connecting this program to the database is that the information becomes lossless even after closing our program a number of times.
